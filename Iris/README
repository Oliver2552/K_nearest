### Tutorial source

The code featured here has been adapted from the YouTube tutorial series "Machine Learning with Python" by Sentdex (Harrison Kinsley) however, changed so that it takes in the Iris dataset.

## About the Project

A from-scratch implementation of K Nearest Neighbours classification algorithm utilizing the Iris dataset.

While it would have been more efficient to perform classification using sci-kit learn, a from-scratch implemenation serves as an educational tool and this implementation is NOT fit for production use.

In conclusion the model achieves a ~95% accuracy in correctly classifying between 'Iris Setosa', 'Iris Versicolor' and 'Iris Virginica'.

## Usage

1. Download dataset 'iris.data' - this version includes column titles and make sure its in the same working directory as code.
2. Download Code 'IrisClassificationScratch.py' - ensure imported libraries at top are installed.
3. Run code.
