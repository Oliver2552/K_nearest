This folder contains implementations of K Nearest Neighbors, utilizing the 'breast cancer' and 'iris' datasets found on the UCI ML Repository.

Using both datasets, the algorithm was implemented from scratch (without 'sci-kit') baring the 'breast cancer' dataset which includes both from-scratch and sci-kit implementations.
